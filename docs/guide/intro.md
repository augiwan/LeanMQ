# Introduction to LeanMQ

Welcome to LeanMQ, a lightweight, Redis-based message queue designed specifically for reliable internal microservice communication.

## What is LeanMQ?

LeanMQ is a Python library that provides a simple yet powerful message queue implementation built on top of Redis Streams. It's designed to replace unreliable internal webhooks with a robust, performant messaging system while maintaining the familiar webhook-like development experience.

At its core, LeanMQ offers:
- **Reliability**: Never lose a message with built-in persistence and delivery guarantees
- **Simplicity**: Clean API that's easy to learn and use
- **Flexibility**: Works with your existing service architecture
- **Performance**: Lightweight and efficient design based on Redis Streams
