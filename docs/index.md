```sh
pip install leanmq
```

```py
# from leanmq import LeanMQWebhook
webhook = LeanMQWebhook()
```

#### Sending a webhook is easy
```py
# Looks very similar to a POST request
webhook.send("/order/status/", {"id": "123", "status": "shipped"})
```

#### So is receiving them
```py
# Looks just like Flask, FastAPI, etc.
@webhook.get("/order/status/")
def process_order_status(data):
    print(f"Order: {data['id']}, status: {data['status']}")

# Process in a dedicated worker (or scale to 1000s)
webhook.run_service()

# Don't need dedicated workers? Schedule this in a CRON instead.
webhook.process_messages()

```

#### &hellip; and get all of these for free

No need to configure <u>retries</u> or handle <u>rate limiting</u> &bull;
Failed webhooks automatically sent to a <u>dead letter queue</u> &bull;
You can set <u>TTL</u> to automatically expire old webhooks &bull;
<u>Atomic transactions</u> for when you need them &bull;
<u>Persisted</u> data so no more dropped webhooks
