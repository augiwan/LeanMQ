```sh
pip install leanmq
```

```py
# from leanmq import LeanMQWebhook
webhook = LeanMQWebhook()
```

#### Sending a webhook is easy
```py
# Looks very similar to a POST request
webhook.send("/order/status/", {"id": "123", "status": "shipped"})
```

#### So is receiving them
```py
# Looks just like Flask, FastAPI, etc.
@webhook.get("/order/status/")
def process_order_status(data):
    print(f"Order: {data['id']}, status: {data['status']}")

# Process in a dedicated worker (or scale to 1000s)
webhook.run_service()

# Don't need dedicated workers? Schedule this in a CRON instead.
webhook.process_messages()

```

Failed webhooks automatically go to a [dead letter queue](/guide/advanced/queue-management.md#dead-letter-queues-dlqs) &bull;
[Set a TTL](/guide/advanced/queue-management#message-time-to-live-ttl) to automatically expire old webhooks &bull;
[Persisted](/guide/why-leanmq.md#the-leanmq-solution) data so no more dropped webhooks &bull;
[Atomic transactions](/guide/advanced/transactions.md) for when you need them
